-👋 Hello, I'm @wanderleiADS a Systems Analysis and Development student at Gran Faculdade EAD, I'm in the Fifth Semester.
- 👀 I'm interested in migrating area, I currently don't work in technology, I'm a doorman “I'm just a router, I receive and send packets or a FireWall, I block or let packets in” jokes aside, I'm very excited about this ADS course at Gran Faculdade because it's mine first undergraduate technology course.
- 🌱 I'm currently learning Full Stack with Node.js, React, insomnia using Git and Github Vscode etc. 
- 💞 ️ I try to collaborate on projects and whatever comes up I'm open to learning.
- 📫 contact wanderlei.jesus@faculdadegran.edu.br 
- 😄 
- ⚡ Curiosity: I like reading and also drawing although I don't draw much these days, my hobby is cycling, running, contact with nature. I'm very inquiring about technology. The news in the technological world is fascinating and I'm very interested.
